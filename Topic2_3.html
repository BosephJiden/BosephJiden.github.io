    <ul>
        <li>A theory is a proposed explanation of a scientific phenomenon</li>
        <li>Once piece of evidence countering a theory can render the entire theory invalid</li>
        <li>Fossil records show changes in animals over time</li>
        <li>Natural Selection</li>

                By Charles Darwin, it is the currently accepted mechanism for evolution. It has 5 main points - 
                that all species produce more offspring than can survive, that each individual in a species is different, that nature selects the individuals that survive in an environment,
                that survivors breed and pass on favourable characteristics to offspring, and that each generation is slightly different than the previous and is built upon the features of all until it.
