<h1>Evolution</h1>
<h2>Important stuff (More will be covered through Genetics)</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <img src="Topic 2/birds.png" style="float:right;width:497px;height:297px;"">
        <li>A theory is a proposed explanation of a scientific phenomenon</li>
        <li>Once piece of evidence countering a theory can render the entire theory invalid</li>
        <li>Fossil records show changes in animals over time</li>
        <li>Natural Selection</li>
        <ul>
            <p>
                By Charles Darwin, it is the currently accepted mechanism for evolution. It has 5 main points - 
                that all species produce more offspring than can survive, that each individual in a species is different, that nature selects the individuals that survive in an environment,
                that survivors breed and pass on favourable characteristics to offspring, and that each generation is slightly different than the previous and is built upon the features of all until it.
            </p>
        </ul>
        <li>Variations</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Makes sure that memebers are adapted to a changing environment.</li>
            <li>Come from sexual reproduction, meiosis (cell duplication in sex cells) and mutations</li>
            <li>Ensures that the members more suited for the environment survive and pass those traits to offspring</li>
            
            <li>4 types</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Structural: Changes in the physical characteristics of a species</li>
                <li>Biochemical: Changes in the chemical composition of various parts, such as blood</li>
                <img src="Topic 2/frogs.png" style="float:right;width:500px;height:250px;"">
                <li>Physiological: Change in the abilities of a species</li>
                <li>Developmental: Changes in the timing of certain developments such as puberty</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Behavioural changes lead to variations as a member adapts to their new behaviours.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Comparative Anatomy</li>
        <ul>
            <li>When basic structures in different species are similar</li>
            <li>An example is the pentadactyl limb, which is consistent across some fish, all amphibians, reptiles, mammals and bird, with five finger-like protrusions in the limb</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Gene pool</strong> is all available genes in a population</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Genetics (The important bit)</h1>
<h2>3.1: DNA, RNA and Cell Division</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Deoxyribonucleic acid is within all cells, and is in the nucleus</li>
    <li>All DNA molecules have the same general structure(double helix)</li>
    <li>Is a nucleic acid. Base units are called nucleotides.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>3 main compounds in a nucleotide</li>
        <li>A nitrogenous base (adenine (A), thymine(T), guanine(T) and cytosine(C))</li>
        <li>A 5-carbon sugar (deoxyribose)</li>
        <li>A phosphate group</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The sugar and phosphate bond to form a backbone, and form a chain</li>
    <li>2 of these chains join to form DNA</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Bases on each chain are bonded to each other by hydrogenous bonds</li>
        <li>Happens due to attraction between hydrogen and flourine, nitrogen or oxygen</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Bases have complementary pairs: A and T, and C and G</li>
    <li>DNA is coiled around proteins called histones to form chromatin</li>
    <li>Chromatin compacts to form chromosomes before cell division</li>
    <li>DNA Replication</li>
    <ul>
        <li>4 proteins: helicase, primase, ligase and polymerase</li>
        <li>Helicase splits the strand into polynucletide chains</li>
        <li>Primase creates a "primer" for polymerase</li>
        <li>Polymerase actually creates the DNA</li>
        <li>Ligase seals the strands up by removing primers and adding bases in those holes</li>
        <li>There's two strands, a leading and lagging strand</li>
        <li>DNA replication only occurs from the <strong>5 prime to the 3 prime ends</strong></li>
        <li>The lagging strands runs as a 3-5 prime strand</li>
        <li>This problem is solved by primase creating small fragments with a 5 and 3 prime at each end</li>
        <li>Polymerase then fills these small fragments called <strong>Okazaki Fragments</strong></li>
    </ul>
</ul>
