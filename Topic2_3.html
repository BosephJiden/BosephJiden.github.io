                By Charles Darwin, it is the currently accepted mechanism for evolution. It has 5 main points - 
                that all species produce more offspring than can survive, that each individual in a species is different, that nature selects the individuals that survive in an environment,
                that survivors breed and pass on favourable characteristics to offspring, and that each generation is slightly different than the previous and is built upon the features of all until it.

            <li>Come from sexual reproduction, meiosis (cell duplication in sex cells) and mutations</li>
            <li>Ensures that the members more suited for the environment survive and pass those traits to offspring</li>
            
            <li>4 types</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Structural: Changes in the physical characteristics of a species</li>
                <li>Biochemical: Changes in the chemical composition of various parts, such as blood</li>

                <li>Physiological: Change in the abilities of a species</li>
                <li>Developmental: Changes in the timing of certain developments such as puberty</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Behavioural changes lead to variations as a member adapts to their new behaviours.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>When basic structures in different species are similar</li>
            <li>An example is the pentadactyl limb, which is consistent across some fish, all amphibians, reptiles, mammals and bird, with five finger-like protrusions in the limb</li>
