<h1>Introduction and Learning Intentions</h1>
<p>
    This is a unit focused on understanding plate tectonics, the structure of the Earth and the 
    history of the theory behind plate tectonics. <br>
    Students will learn to:
    <ul>
        <li>Describe the theory of plate tectonics and its supporting evidence</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The ‘jigsaw fit’ of the continental shelves</li>
            <li>Matching up identical fossils on different continents</li>
            <li>The profile of the ocean floor</li>
            <li>The age of seafloor rocks</li>
            <li>Magnetic reversals and seafloor rocks</li>
            <li>Explain the idea of Pangaea and how the continents have reached their current positions</li>
            <li>Explain how continental movement could be driven by convection currents within the Earth as a result of heat and gravity</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Explain the difference between transform, convergent and divergent boundaries</li>
        <li>Model types of plate boundaries and account for the formation of the following features at each type of boundary:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Divergent boundaries: rift valley, mid-ocean ridge, normal and transform faults</li>
            <li>Convergent boundaries: mountain range, ocean trench, reverse faults and folds</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Explain volcanic eruptions and earthquakes </li>
        <li>Explain the formation of a tsunami by an undersea earthquake </li>
        <li>Outline some of the technologies that can be used to identify and explain natural disasters </li>
    </ul>

<h1>Unit 1.1: Revision</h1>
<h2>Structure of the Earth</h2>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/structure-world-that-divided-into-600nw-1381507469.jpg" alt="Diagram of Earth's layers" style="float:right;width:300px;height:277px;">
    Discovery that Earth wasn't fully solid came about 100 years ago when seismology - the study of earthquakes - became advanced enough that we could study the paths of shockwaves.
    <br> <br>
    The diagram illustrates the layers of earth, namely the crust, mantle, outer core and inner core.
</p>
<h3>Lithosphere</h3>
<p>
    The lithosphere is the term used to describe the fusing of two layers of the earth, the mantle and the crust. 
    Attached to the bottom of the crust is a layer of mantle that has "fused" to the bottom of the crust.
