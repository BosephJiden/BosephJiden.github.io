<title>Dynamic Earth</title>
<h1>Introduction and Learning Intentions</h1>
<p>This is a unit focused on understanding plate tectonics, the structure of the Earth and the 
    history of the theory behind plate tectonics. <br>
    Students will learn to:
    <ul>
        Describe the theory of plate tectonics and its supporting evidence
        <ul>
            The ‘jigsaw fit’ of the continental shelves
            Matching up identical fossils on different continents
            The profile of the ocean floor
            The age of seafloor rocks
            Magnetic reversals and seafloor rocks
            Explain the idea of Pangaea and how the continents have reached their current positions
            Explain how continental movement could be driven by convection currents within the Earth as a result of heat and gravity
        </ul>
        Explain the difference between transform, convergent and divergent boundaries
        Model types of plate boundaries and account for the formation of the following features at each type of boundary:
        <ul>
            Divergent boundaries: rift valley, mid-ocean ridge, normal and transform faults
            Convergent boundaries: mountain range, ocean trench, reverse faults and folds
        </ul>
        Explain volcanic eruptions and earthquakes
        Explain the formation of a tsunami by an undersea earthquake 
        Outline some of the technologies that can be used to identify and explain natural disasters
    </ul>
</p>
<h1>Unit 1.1: Revision</h1>
<h2>Structure of the Earth</h2>
<div class="indent">
    <p>
        Discovery that Earth wasn't fully solid came about 100 years ago when seismology - the study of earthquakes 
        - became advanced enough that we could study the paths of shockwaves.

        The diagram illustrates the layers of earth, namely the crust, mantle, outer core and inner core.
