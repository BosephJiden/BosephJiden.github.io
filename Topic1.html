<h1>Introduction and Learning Intentions</h1>
<p>
    This is a unit focused on understanding plate tectonics, the structure of the Earth and the 
    history of the theory behind plate tectonics. <br>
    Students will learn to:
    <ul>
        <li>Describe the theory of plate tectonics and its supporting evidence</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The ‘jigsaw fit’ of the continental shelves</li>
            <li>Matching up identical fossils on different continents</li>
            <li>The profile of the ocean floor</li>
            <li>The age of seafloor rocks</li>
            <li>Magnetic reversals and seafloor rocks</li>
            <li>Explain the idea of Pangaea and how the continents have reached their current positions</li>
            <li>Explain how continental movement could be driven by convection currents within the Earth as a result of heat and gravity</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Explain the difference between transform, convergent and divergent boundaries</li>
        <li>Model types of plate boundaries and account for the formation of the following features at each type of boundary:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Divergent boundaries: rift valley, mid-ocean ridge, normal and transform faults</li>
            <li>Convergent boundaries: mountain range, ocean trench, reverse faults and folds</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Explain volcanic eruptions and earthquakes </li>
        <li>Explain the formation of a tsunami by an undersea earthquake </li>
        <li>Outline some of the technologies that can be used to identify and explain natural disasters </li>
    </ul>

<h1>Structure of the Earth</h1>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/structure-world-that-divided-into-600nw-1381507469.jpg" alt="Diagram of Earth's layers" style="float:right;width:300px;height:277px;">
    Discovery that Earth wasn't fully solid came about 100 years ago when seismology - the study of earthquakes - became advanced enough that we could study the paths of shockwaves.
    <br> <br>
    The diagram illustrates the layers of earth, namely the crust, mantle, outer core and inner core.
</p>
<h2>Lithosphere</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>lithosphere</strong> is the term used to describe the fusing of two layers of the earth, the mantle and the crust. Attached to the bottom of the crust 
    is a layer of mantle that has "fused" to the bottom of the crust. Below that is the slippery layer, which the lithosphere floats on. We have also learnt
    that the lithosphere is not one piece, but made of small pieces called tectonic plates.
</p>
<h1>Seismology</h1>
<h2>Earthquakes and Seismic Waves</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Earthquakes</strong> are caused by sudden jerking movements in Earth's crust. The sudden release of enormous energies sends out shockwaves which radiate out from the focus,
    or epicentre of the quake. These waves are measured with a <strong>seismometer</strong>. 
    <br><br>
    Shock waves are refracted by different density rocks, and some waves don't pass the liquid outer core. Our understanding of the planet's structure is based on how waves travel through
    the planet.
</p>
<h3>P and S Waves</h3>
<p>
    There are several types of shockwaves from an earthquake. The fastest ones, called Primary (P) waves, always arrive first at the seismometer. The slower Secondary (S) waves arrive later.
    The time-gap between the two is used to determine the distance from the seismometer and the quake.
</p>
<h1>History of Continental Drift</h1>
<h2>Alfred Wegener</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trained in astronomy, became interested in Earth science</li>
        <li>Found many examples of identical mineral, fossil deposits, and geological features on different continents</li>
        <li>Published theory of continental drift in 1915</li>
        <li>Put forward a lot of evidence but was missing an explanation as to why they moved</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Development of theory</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>New maps of the ocean floor, magnetic data and rock samples from deep sea drilling built evidence to prove Wegener right</li>
        <li>Theory of plate tectonics, where earth's crust wasn't one piece but broken into plates, was formed</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h1>Structure of a tectonic plate</h1>
<h1>Plate boundaries</h1>
<p>
    There are two main types of plate boundaries, convergent and divergent.
</p>
<h2>Divergent</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>When plates move apart, a gap is created</li>
        <li>This gap is immediately filled with molten rock billowing from mantle</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Convergent</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>When plates move together, two things can occur</li>
        <li>Subduction:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>When one plate moves under another</li>
            <li>Usually at oceanic-continental boundaries</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Mountain building:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>When two plates are continental, they are crumpled to form mountains</li>
            <li>Continental-continental boundaries</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</p>
<h1>Causes behind the movement</h1>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pressure on inner core keeps it solid when it should be liquid</li>
        <li>Heat is carried outwards from the core through mantle</li>
        <li>This heat rubs along the bottom of lithosphere, cools down, then the cooled matter goes back down to core to form a convection current</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h1>Evidence for moving plates</h1>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shape of continental shelves</li>
        <li>Fossil and mineral evidence</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Fossil deposits from same age and of same species found on different continents, suggesting that the continents were linked together at some point</li>
            <li>Mineral deposits and geological features follow a similar pattern</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Mid-ocean ridges</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Rocks in parallel ridges have same age</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
