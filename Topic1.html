<h1>Structure of the Earth</h1>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/structure-world-that-divided-into-600nw-1381507469.jpg" alt="Diagram of Earth's layers" style="float:right;width:300px;height:277px;">
    Discovery that Earth wasn't fully solid came about 100 years ago when seismology - the study of earthquakes - became advanced enough that we could study the paths of shockwaves.
    <br> <br>
    The diagram illustrates the layers of earth, namely the crust, mantle, outer core and inner core.
</p>
<h2>Lithosphere</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>lithosphere</strong> is the term used to describe the fusing of two layers of the earth, the mantle and the crust. Attached to the bottom of the crust 
    is a layer of mantle that has "fused" to the bottom of the crust. Below that is the slippery layer, which the lithosphere floats on. We have also learnt
    that the lithosphere is not one piece, but made of small pieces called tectonic plates.
</p>
<h1>Seismology</h1>
<h2>Earthquakes and Seismic Waves</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Earthquakes</strong> are caused by sudden jerking movements in Earth's crust. The sudden release of enormous energies sends out shockwaves which radiate out from the focus,
    or epicentre of the quake. These waves are measured with a <strong>seismometer</strong>. 
    <br><br>
    Shock waves are refracted by different density rocks, and some waves don't pass the liquid outer core. Our understanding of the planet's structure is based on how waves travel through
    the planet.
</p>
<h3>P and S Waves</h3>
<p>
    There are several types of shockwaves from an earthquake. The fastest ones, called Primary (P) waves, always arrive first at the seismometer. The slower Secondary (S) waves arrive later.
    The time-gap between the two is used to determine the distance from the seismometer and the quake.
</p>
<h1>History of Continental Drift</h1>
<h2>Alfred Wegener</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trained in astronomy, became interested in Earth science</li>
        <li>Found many examples of identical mineral, fossil deposits, and geological features on different continents</li>
        <li>Published theory of continental drift in 1915</li>
        <li>Put forward a lot of evidence but was missing an explanation as to why they moved</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Development of theory</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>New maps of the ocean floor, magnetic data and rock samples from deep sea drilling built evidence to prove Wegener right</li>
        <li>Theory of plate tectonics, where earth's crust wasn't one piece but broken into plates, was formed</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h1>Structure of a tectonic plate</h1>
<h1>Plate boundaries</h1>
<p>
    There are two main types of plate boundaries, convergent and divergent.
</p>
<h2>Divergent</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>When plates move apart, a gap is created</li>
        <li>This gap is immediately filled with molten rock billowing from mantle</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Convergent</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>When plates move together, two things can occur</li>
        <li>Subduction:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>When one plate moves under another</li>
            <li>Usually at oceanic-continental boundaries</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Mountain building:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>When two plates are continental, they are crumpled to form mountains</li>
            <li>Continental-continental boundaries</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</p>
<h1>Causes behind the movement</h1>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pressure on inner core keeps it solid when it should be liquid</li>
        <li>Heat is carried outwards from the core through mantle</li>
        <li>This heat rubs along the bottom of lithosphere, cools down, then the cooled matter goes back down to core to form a convection current</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h1>Evidence for moving plates</h1>
<p>
    <img src="Topic 1/MidOceanRidges.png" style="float:right;width:270.5px;height:162px;">
    <ul>
        <li>Shape of continental shelves</li>
        <li>Fossil and mineral evidence</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Fossil deposits from same age and of same species found on different continents, suggesting that the continents were linked together at some point</li>
            <li>Mineral deposits and geological features follow a similar pattern</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Mid-ocean ridges</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Rocks in parallel ridges have same age</li>
            <li>Residual magentism also shows symmetry on either side of a ridge</li>
            <ul>
                Residual magnetism is caused by the flipping of Earth's poles ever so often <br>
                This flipping is preserved in the rock's orientation even when poles flip again
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Seismology</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Most earthquakes are concentrated around plate boundaries</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</p>
<h1>Supercontinents</h1>
<h2>Pangaea and Panthalassa</h2>
<p>
    All this evidence indicates the existence of a supercontinent named Pangaea about 200 million years ago, where all the continents were joined up.
    Evidence also suggests the breaking up of the continent about 180 million years ago into Laurasia and Gondwana.<br>
    Until 45 million years ago, Australia was a part of Antarctica. Now it is moving slowly north, heading towards south-east Asia.<br>
    The ocean around Pangaea (whole earth) was called Panthalassa (whole ocean).
</p>
<h2>Supercycles</h2>
<p>
    Continents are thought to have cycles where the breakup of one supercontinent into smaller continents leads to the eventual formation of another supercontinent,
    and so on. These cycles are known as supercycles. They happen every 4-500 million years and are thought to have huge impacts on climate.
</p>
<h2>Effects on climate</h2>
<p>
    World is generally colder and drier, with permanent ice caps at the poles, and lower sea levels. This is due to reduced volcanic and tectonic activity. There are, as a result, lower CO<sub>2</sub> levels. <br>
    Please note, as I know you will find a way to spin this, climate change is accelerating these effects. The change in climate and other factors should not be happening this quickly.
</p>
<h1>Tectonic Australia</h1>
<h2>Cratons</h2>
<img src="Topic 1/Plate movements.png" style="float:right;width:347px;height:259;">
<p>
    A craton is a mass of continental rock that is both ancient and stable. They are unlikely to break up since they are usually too thick to be broken up
    by tectonic movements. It is a chunk of continent that has managed to stay in one piece through several supercycles.<br> <br>
    Most of Western Australia is formed out of two cratons, the Pilbara and Yilgarn cratons. They appear to have joined together 2300 million years ago. Several other cratons joined in the following 
    billion years to form one exceptionally stable landmass. After the breakup of Pangaea's predecessor, Rodinia, Eastern Australia became a collision zone. While most of the continent was under a shallow sea, Eastern Australia collided with another plate, turning it 
    into a large subduction zone. The increased volcanic activity accelerated the deposit of sediment in the region, creating vast deposits of minerals in the region. This collision is also thought to have formed the Great Dividing Range. <br> <br>
    Since Australia broke apart from Gondwana, it has been very inactive tectonically, leading to the main process acting being erosion, creating the flat landscape we see today and the coastal plains where over 80% of the population
    lives. 
</p>
<h1>Impacts of tectonic events</h1>
<p>
    Volcanoes
    <ul>
        <li>Volcanic eruptions release many harmful gases and ash into the air</li>
        <li>Lava flows</li>
        <ul>
            2 main types that cause harm to populations  
            <li>Pyroclastic flows</li>
            <ul>
                A pyroclastic flow is a cloud of red hot ash and poisonous gas flowing down a volcano at over 100 km/h. Nothing survives.
            </ul>
            <li>Lahars</li>
            <ul>
                A lahar is a flow of mud, water, ash and debris from a melted glacier or burst lake on the volcano.
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    Earthquakes
    <ul>
        <li>The motion of the ground is not the biggest harm to people. The collapse of infrastructure due to the motion is the real killer</li>
        <li>When a large earthquake hits a large city, the effects are often devastating</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Apartments concertina, which is effectively a top to bottom domino effect of floors collapsing</li>
            <li>People who rush into the streets are showered with glass and tiles</li>
            <li>Gas and water mains, coupled with electricity cables, rupture, sparking massive fires</li>
            <li>A quake in a hilly area is often coupled with a landslide, which can bury entire communtities under rubble</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
