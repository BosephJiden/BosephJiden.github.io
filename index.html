<h1>AC's Science Notes</h1>
<p>These notes are always a work in progress. For any feedback, please don't hesitate to tell me.</p>
<p>For revision, please consider copying these notes and pasting them into an AI program of your choice (I recommend Gemini), and asking the AI to create revision questions for you.
    This works like a live Q and A session, with the AI giving you feedback as you feed your answers in. This is a great method for revising each topic.
